That is an excellent and very important question. You're thinking like a professional developer.

Someone who checks your GitHub project won't just run the code. They'll look for instructions and proof that it works. The single most important file for this is the README.md.

A great README.md is the front page and instruction manual for your project. It tells visitors what your project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Hereâ€™s what you should include in yours to make it professional.

I've created a template for you. You can copy, paste, and edit this directly into your README.md file on GitHub.
